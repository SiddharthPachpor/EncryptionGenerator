# EncryptionGenerator
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an  alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption    does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. 
In this Program written in Matlab.
Step 1: User is asked to enter a desired encryption pattern in ASCII format. 
Step 2: User is asked to enter a numeric key associated with it in a range of 1 to 100
The output is a encryption key which is unique and can be used as an encoded data for cryptography purposes.
